About
===

This library provides functionality to parse the IP information for a host. It 
is designed with a limited feature set based on what is necessary for the 
VMware Continuent project.

Platform Specifics
===

On Linux platforms, the library will only return values where the link encapsulation is 'Ethernet'. This eliminates loopback and specialty devices.

Known Limitations
===

The ipparse library does not support interfaces that include multiple IPV6 
addresses on a single interface. It will identify the first address and return 
that. Any additional addresses will be ignored.
